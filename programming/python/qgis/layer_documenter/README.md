## Layer Documenter - A QGIS plugin

### Document a qgis raster or vector layer either before or after it has been exported. 

Layer Documentor allows the user to generate a documentation/read me in the form of a <em>.txt</em> file saved in the folder of their choosing. Key items such as 'geometry type', 'layer name', 'field name', 'aliases' and 'Coordinate Reference System' is all prefilled. Users have the option of adding a semantic description of the layer, author/company names and any associated topology rules or instructions.
